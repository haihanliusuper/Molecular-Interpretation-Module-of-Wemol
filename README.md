# Graph-based-Molecular-Interpretation-Module-of-Wemol
We propose a dual-branch linear attention pooling that multiplies learnable attention scores with sigmoid-gated mask coefficients to weight each node’s contribution, replacing conventional global pooling and boosting both expressiveness and interpretability of QSAR models.
Lightweight operations—such as sequence analysis, antibody humanization, or small-molecule property prediction—generally complete within minutes. More computationally intensive tasks, including molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and large-scale docking, typically require several hours to a few days. The platform permits unlimited simultaneous user access; job scheduling is managed by a centralized cloud scheduler. A global limit of approximately 100 concurrent tasks is maintained to ensure system stability, with additional jobs automatically queued. Trial accounts support 1–2 parallel jobs, while paid users can scale concurrency according to project needs.
For resource-intensive tasks, Wemol adopts a transparent credit-based model. A 200-ns MD simulation consumes ~25,000 compute credits (50$), scaling linearly with simulation length. A docking screen of 10,000 compounds typically requires 2,500 credits (5$), also with linear scaling.
